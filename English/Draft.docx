Title: Big Data: Big Opportunities or Big Questions?
Key Words: big data, data mining, analytics, big data divide
Introduction
As mobile phones and computers connect people from all over the world together, we have been in a data era. The data generated in one second is more than that stored by all devices 20 years ago. Just as Anderson, Editor-in-Chief of Wired, said, we have entered “The Petabyte Age”. Then, the term “big data” is discussed by both scientific researchers and social scientist. In fact, big data is not only about big size (volume) but also velocity and variety, which are known as 3 v’s of big data. Plenty of researches have been conducted to verify the powerfulness of information system and decision processes based on big data. And many of them come to a result that big data-driven process gives better decisions compared with intuition-based process, especially in the long run. While many data scientists believe big data and data mining technique are the future of our society, socialists view this opportunity from an opposite view and give out some critical thinking, even some big questions. One of them is “big data divide”, which means that companies such as Facebook and Twitter which collects and controls the big data can change the game rules of our society, while individuals who can’t access to big data can only wait for being changed and influenced. 
Data scientists only claim the big advantages of big data, while social scientists use more words to discuss the potential problems with it. Few research gives comprehensive understanding of the relationship between big data and our society. This research will try to fill this blank by first introducing the definitions of big data, then verifying the effectiveness of big data-driven decision processes with valid examples and finally giving some potential problems and possible solutions.

Potential Themes:
Definitions of big data:
	Though the term big data is popular among companies and colleges, it is not formally defined. The most common definition of big data comes from Doug Laney in his 2001 paper, 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity and Variety. “Big data is different from small data from three key factors: volume, velocity and variety”. Therefore, big data is not only data with large size but also data comes in at a fast speed with various forms. From this point of view, dealing with big data is a large challenge since it is so different with traditional data set. Luckily, data scientists find that simple algorithms such as linear regression and cluster algorithms work well on big data. Dealing with the relationship between big data and our society is a bigger challenge from a socialist’s view. So they give new definitions of big data from this point of view. For example, Boyd defines big data as a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis and mythology. Boyd puts much emphasis on big data’s influence on people’s daily life and daily decision process. Both definitions can give us infights to big data, so this theme is worth discussing.

Efficiency of big data:
	Many companies claim that they use more big data-driven methods when running their business. But is there any significant performance gap between big data-driven companies and intuition-driven companies or how large is the gap? Many researches have some strong evidences for efficiency of big data-driven decision processes. For example, many airline companies use big data-based methods to predict ETA, which is significant better than the ETA given by experienced pilots who is busy with other instruments during flights. Given valid examples supporting the efficiency of big data, we also need to go beyond this efficiency. It is still people who decide which question to ask and which problem to be solved. Therefore, in this data era, big data can’t place human brains, especially for our visions and insights. And I think it’s necessary to provide some critical thinking about big data’s efficiency to avoid abuse of it.

Privacy problems:
	Privacy is a big concern during internet era. During this data era, the problem is changed from its root. During internet era, you are able to put what you want people see on the website while hiding other private information to protect yourself. However, some research shows that companies can dig more than you give to them with big data methods. On the one hand, it can give intelligent promotions based on your past behaviors. On the other hand, it can estimate your economic status using only limited data. And companies can stop an insurance just before you meet a severe economic problem. So, we need to understand the privacy in the context of big data.

Assessment of readings:
There are plenty of reading materials including academic paper, magazines, books and online articles on big data. Not surprisingly, people’s attitudes toward bid data divide. Data scientists, physicians and mathematicians hold positive attitudes. In “Big Data: The Management Revolution”, Andrew McAfee from MIT conducted structured interviews to show better performance of data-driven companies. Among all the 330 senior executives from different companies, those from data-driven companies have higher confidence and achieve better performance. Steve LaValle also agrees analytics and big data can help companies to predict unseen patterns from collected data. And once companies turn these patterns and insights to actions, they can make produce large values. However, socialists show their concern about big data. The Big Data Divide by Mark Andrejevic shows a tendency of “big data rich”. Individuals are less likely to gain knowledge compared with large companies. And Boyd, in his article “critical questions for big data”, argues that the power of big data is only available to companies who collect and control them. Others have no means to get access or deal with the data.
