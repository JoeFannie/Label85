Common:
To accord with modern society, all of the three branches have developed and changed. They all respect personal choices to some extent.
Religion is an important part of life. No matter which one out of the three a Jew chooses to join in, he or she will practice religion in his or her own way. 

Sherry:
Agree with the idea that “religion being a very important part of life”
When practicing a religion gives her “a very strong connection to family”
She can’t join in the Orthodox movement because “women can’t pray publicly as the men”



Malka Belfer
Mrs. Belfer is a typical Orthodox, who wore “sheitel” to cover her hair according to the belief (p159).
 
Malkie lives with her family as a typical Orthodox girl. She obeys some rules strictly. For example, she stopped her mother from taking the phone during “yontif” (p158). And but she wore a skirt that fully covers her knees during some rituals (p160). But she also practices religious rules in her own way. For example, she has a strong career ambition. “in a culture where both women and men typically lacked lofty career ambitions, seeing jobs as necessary but dreary tasks that should never consume much of a Hasid’s central thoughts” (p162). She wants a high-powered job because she sees the limitation beyond the lack of money from her family. Financial power enables her to see more and experience more from the outside world.
